- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Shekhar Sharma (@sshar1729). I am a third year Ph.D. student in the department of computational condensed matter and theoretical physics at Arizona State University in Tempe, AZ, USA.  
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning and using the tools of machine learning, AI and especially the scope of using the quantuam computation in applying my research. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) to study the strongly correlated electron systems.
