- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Shekhar Sharma (@sshar1729). I am a final-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computational Condensed Matter and Theoretical Physics at Arizona State University in Tempe, AZ, USA.  
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning and using the tools of machine learning, AI, and especially the scope of applying quantum computation in my research. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) to study the strongly correlated electron systems.
- In the past, I have worked on different projects using the Density Functional Theory, Phonon Calculations, and Many-Body calculations. You can find a comprehensive summary of my work on my Google Scholar profile:
